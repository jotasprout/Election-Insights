# Prez Play Pro
See my _interactive data visualization of presidential election results_ [here](http://roxorsoxor.com/prezplaypro/index.html).

* Python scripts for scraping various data sources
* D3.js for data viz

## Examples
![Screenshot of webpage showing map of USA made with D3. Each state is a different color depending on which candidate won.](https://jotascript.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/screen-shot-2018-10-18-at-9-51-39-pm.png?w=640)

The above map shows socialist candidates whose party affiliations may or may not have the word "socialist" in their names -- including Jill Stein.

The below map shows socialist candidates except for Jill Stein (Green).

Gray states are those with no socialist candidates (or there were socialist candidates but they received zero votes).

### Coming Soon
- Menu will be dynamic. Only candidates used for map will appear in legend. A candidate may appear in the legend but not in the map because they were a candidate in a state but they did not win.
- User will be able to click candidate(s) in the legend to add or remove them from map.

## Schema
![Schema diagram showing tables with columns for candidates, states, party affiliations, and election results.](https://jotascript.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/schema_101618.png)

Like the U.S. Constitution, this schema is a living document and has evolved over time.
