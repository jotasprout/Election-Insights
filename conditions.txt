Use brackets



SELECT * 
FROM  `nam_order_items` 
WHERE (item_status =  'Glass Bending - Andy'
OR item_status =  'Glass Bending - Bren'
OR item_status =  'Glass Bending - Gary'
OR item_status =  'Glass Bending - James'
OR item_status =  'Glass Bending - Oscar')
AND (`backing_cut` = 0 OR `backing_cut` = 1 OR `backing_bent` = 0 OR `backing_bent` = 1)



you could also use value in array as



SELECT * 
FROM  `nam_order_items` 
WHERE `item_status` IN  ('Glass Bending - Andy','Glass Bending - Bren','Glass Bending - Gary','Glass Bending - James','Glass Bending - Oscar')
AND (`backing_cut` = 0 OR `backing_cut` = 1 OR `backing_bent` = 0 OR `backing_bent` = 1)



you could then build your array using php and simply do something like:





$options = array('Glass Bending - Andy','Glass Bending - Bren','Glass Bending - Gary','Glass Bending - James','Glass Bending - Oscar');

$sql = "SELECT * FROM `nam_order_items` WHERE `item_status` IN ({implode(',', $options}) AND (`backing_cut` = 0 OR `backing_cut` = 1 OR `backing_bent` = 0 OR `backing_bent` = 1)";





SELECT * FROM table WHERE age >= '18' AND age <= '50' AND (lname = 'Doe' OR lname = 'Smith');





....
WHERE id IN (3, 9, 100, ...)



SELECT 
    productCode, 
    productName, 
    buyPrice
FROM
    products
WHERE
    buyPrice BETWEEN 90 AND 100;



SELECT 
    productCode, 
    productName, 
    buyPrice
FROM
    products
WHERE
    buyPrice NOT BETWEEN 20 AND 100;



SELECT 
    productCode, 
    productName, 
    buyPrice
FROM
    products
WHERE
    buyPrice < 20 OR buyPrice > 100;
